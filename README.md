[Brunch] InHabit Module --with-phaser
========================================================

This is a modern JS skeleton for Brunch and [InHabit].

## Requirements
The only requirement is [Node.js].

## Installation
0. [IHPM] (recommended)  
   Follow `Installation` section on the [IHPM] page, then run `ihpm init project-name phaser`.

0. Git  
   Use `git clone https://github.com/ArkadiumInc/brunch-inhabit-module-js project-name` to clone, then run `npm install` in cloned directory

0. Brunch  
   Install Brunch, then run `brunch new project-name -s ArkadiumInc/brunch-inhabit-module-js`

## Getting started
After you got familiar with [Installation](#Installation) section you can start developing [InHabit] Module.
Try running `npm start`, then follow http://localhost:3333.
There is a live-reloading dev-server.
Now you can open up a preferred code editor (such as [Atom]) and start coding!  
After you are done, try running `npm run build` to build a minified JavaScript and a `package.zip` for uploading.
